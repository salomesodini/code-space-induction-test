Just me, trying to understand how to create a repository & html files 🍀💚
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following activities are recommended:
<br>
<br>
1.Create a repository and call it "code space induction test".<br>
2. Upload the folder containing your index.html web page.<br>
3.Copy and paste the link to your repository into this assignment.<br>
4. Log out of GitHub and try testing your link. If you receive a 404 error, it is more than likely you have not made the version public.<br>
